# Gemini API client for Julia

## Overview

Provides an interface to the Gemini API with native Julia types, taking care of the heavy lifting for integrating your application. Currently fairly feature-sparse, but I'm building this as you read. Stay tuned!

## Usage

`pkg> add Gemini`

See tests for example usage.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome, just open a PR!
As this project grows and matures, I'll come up with interface and style guidelines.
